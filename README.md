## News

- 🔥 Accepted at ICCV'25 

- 🔥 The Napari plugin is out! 👉 Check it out [here](https://github.com/IbrahimaAlain/napari-noise2vst). Thanks to Ibrahima Alain Gueye (intern ENSAI)! 

## Napari plugin

Thanks to Ibrahima Alain Gueye (intern ENSAI) for developing the plugin for Napari. 👉 Check it out [here](https://github.com/IbrahimaAlain/napari-noise2vst).

## Requirements

Here is the list of libraries you need to install to execute the code:
* Python 3.12
* NumPy 1.26.4
* PyTorch 2.2
* Torchvision 0.17
* Matplotlib 3.9

To install in an environment using conda:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate noise2vst
```
## Demo

We provide a Python Jupyter Notebook with example code to reproduce the experiments of the paper: [`demo.ipynb`](demo.ipynb).

## Pre-trained models

We use two popular off-the-shelf neural networks specialized in the removal of **Gaussian noise** (see folder [`models`](models/)):
* **FFDNet** [K. Zhang et al., IEEE Trans IP 2018]
* **DRUNet** [K. Zhang et al., IEEE Trans PAMI 2022]

Their pre-trained weights can be downloaded using the file [`download.py`](pretrained_weights/download.py).

## Noise2VST

Noise2VST is implemented in Pytorch in the file [`noise2vst.py`](models/noise2vst.py). Use the template below within your code:

```
# Instanciate the class
noise2VST = Noise2VST().to(device)

# Training (time depends on the performance of your CPU/GPU)
noise2VST.fit(img_noisy, m_ffdnet_color, nb_iterations=2000)

# Inference
with torch.no_grad():
    img_den = noise2VST(img_noisy, m_drunet_color)
```
